  &lt;title&gt;Deploy&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    So you have worked tirelessly to prepare course notes or a book, built and previewed, synced changes using git, and now you are ready to share the results of your efforts with the world.  It's time to &lt;term&gt;deploy&lt;/term&gt; your project.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    With our codespace setup this is simple.  From the &lt;q&gt;PreTeXt Commands&lt;/q&gt; menu, click on &lt;q&gt;Deploy&lt;/q&gt;.  This will automatically take the most recent build of your web target and host it through &lt;url href="https://pages.github.com/"&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/url&gt;.  Watch the output pane for a link to your published site. (It can take a few minutes for the site to get set up or updated; there should be another link to view the progress of the GitHub &lt;q&gt;action&lt;/q&gt; that reports the progress.)
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

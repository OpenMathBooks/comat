    &lt;title&gt;The publication file&lt;/title&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;pretext /&gt; controls publisher options in a &lt;term&gt;publication file&lt;/term&gt;.  The default location of this file is in the folder &lt;c&gt;publication&lt;/c&gt; and is itself called &lt;c&gt;publication.ptx&lt;/c&gt;.  Open this file and take a look.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        What you will see is more &lt;init&gt;XML&lt;/init&gt;, but a different set of tags than what you would write in your &lt;pretext /&gt; source.  The version of the publication file that came with your codespace was (at the one time) the almost complete list of options with default values provided.  This should make it easy to modify values and experiment with different settings.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        As new settings are introduced, you can find documentation ins the &lt;url href="https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/publication-file-reference.html"&gt;Publication File Reference&lt;/url&gt; part of the guide.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;remark&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Eventually you may want to have different versions of your document, and you can do this with different publication files.  In &lt;xref ref="ch-project" /&gt; we will consider how to manage multiple publication files easily.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/remark&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        Next we will dive deeper into the different sorts of things that can be configured with this file.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;title&gt;Before you arrive...&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;introduction&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Authoring in PreTeXt requires nothing more
            than a wifi connection and GitHub account.
            GitHub users also can share their
            content for free on GitHub Pages!
        &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/introduction&gt;
    &lt;section&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Setting up your GitHub account&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            To create a GitHub account, 
            &lt;url href="https://github.com/signup"&gt;
                follow the instructions on GitHub's
                signup page.
            &lt;/url&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Be sure to note your GitHub username and password in your password manager
            (or however you usually keep track of login credentials) so you can log in
            again durring the workshop.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/section&gt;
    &lt;section&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Apply for your GitHub Education discount&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Educators and non-profit researchers can get many of GitHub's paid features
            for free.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Apply at
            &lt;url href="https://education.github.com/discount_requests/pack_application"&gt;Education.GitHub.com&lt;/url&gt;
            to unlock these features (in our experience, applications are usually processed quickly for &lt;c&gt;.edu&lt;/c&gt;
            email addresses).
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/section&gt;
    &lt;section&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;And that's it!&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Even just a last year, the process to get started writing PreTeXt
            involved several more steps. (Raise your hand if you don't care what a
            &lt;q&gt;PATH variable&lt;/q&gt; is!)
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The community is streamlining this experience
            daily, and we look forward to sharing how easy writing in PreTeXt is when we see you at the workshop.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/chapter&gt;

  &lt;title&gt;Using Pandoc&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    If you have a number of individual documents that you would like to convert, from pretty much any format, consider trying &lt;url href="https://pandoc.org/"&gt;Pandoc&lt;/url&gt;.  This command-line tool can read in lots of different formats and output in lots of different formats.  Unfortunately, &lt;pretext /&gt; is not a default output format, so you need to use a custom &lt;term&gt;writer&lt;/term&gt;. 
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    The pretext-tools VS Code extension has a shortcut for using the custom writer and pandoc, assuming you have pandoc installed (which you will if you use a codespace).  You will need to upload the file you want to convert, either by dragging it to the Explorer menu in VS Code.  Then open the Command Pallet with &lt;c&gt;CTRL+SHIFT+P&lt;/c&gt; and start typing &lt;q&gt;pretext: convert file to pretext&lt;/q&gt; and select the item to shows up.  You will be prompted for the name of the file you want to convert.  The file will be converted and opened in a new tab.  You can then copy/paste the contents into your main documents.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    You can also use Pandoc outside of VS Code.  Install pandoc from their website.  Then download the this &lt;url href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oscarlevin/pandoc-pretext/master/pretext.lua"&gt;writer&lt;/url&gt; and put it somewhere you will remember.   
    Documentation for how to use this tool is available on its &lt;url href="https://github.com/oscarlevin/pandoc-pretext"&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/url&gt;.
  &lt;/p&gt;

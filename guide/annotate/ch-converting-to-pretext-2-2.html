    Your goal in doing a conversion should be to move all your materials into &lt;pretext /&gt; and then always work from the &lt;pretext /&gt; source, converting back to other formats as needed.  It is simply not feasible to keep converting to &lt;pretext /&gt;, since this process is not automatic.
&lt;/p&gt;

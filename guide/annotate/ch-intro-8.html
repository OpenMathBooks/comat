  &lt;title&gt;Links&lt;/title&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    In addition to the ability to reference inside a document, such as this one to &lt;xref ref="note" /&gt;, you can also link to files that you might want readers to download.  Here is an example:
    &lt;url href="external/sheets/Fibonacci.xlsx" /&gt;.  Note that this file is stored in your &lt;c&gt;assets&lt;/c&gt; folder, and is automatically put in &lt;c&gt;external&lt;/c&gt; when pretext build the file.
  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;

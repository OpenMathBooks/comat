  &lt;title&gt;Official documentation&lt;/title&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Note that the official &lt;url href="https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/guide-toc.html"&gt;PreTeXt Guide&lt;/url&gt; can be hard to use because there is so much stuff in it.  Additionally, some of the documentation is out of date.  Still, if you know where to look, it is a great resource.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    Here are some sections that we find especially helpful:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;url href="https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/part-basics.html"&gt;Basics Reference&lt;/url&gt;: A listing of the main elements of &lt;pretext /&gt; including snippets of the code that create them.  This is one of the few places in the guide that has examples of the markup.
        &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;url href="https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/publication-file-reference.html"&gt;Publication File Reference&lt;/url&gt;: When you are ready to start changing how your output looks, you can use the &lt;term&gt;publication file&lt;/term&gt;, which is described in this part of the guide. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;url href="https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/schema.html"&gt;PreTeXt Schema&lt;/url&gt;: The official list of elements and where they can go is given in the PreTeXt Schema, which is described here.  Also you can check out the &lt;url href="https://pretextbook.org/doc/schema/"&gt;schema browser&lt;/url&gt; to actually view the schema.
        &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;url href="https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/quickstart-getting-pretext.html"&gt;Getting PreTeXt&lt;/url&gt;: If you want to install &lt;pretext /&gt; on your own computer, this early part of the guide gives you directions.  It should be updated with information on CodeSpaces soon as well, if you need a refresher.
        &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    Finally, note that the search in &lt;pretext /&gt; now works really well, and searching for a feature will usually get you pointed in the right spot.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/paragraphs&gt;

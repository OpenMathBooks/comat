    &lt;title&gt;Not Just HTML, Not Just PDF&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; This document is available in HTML format at &lt;url href="https://stevenclontz.github.io/pretext-getting-started-2023/" /&gt;, and the same document is
        available in a PDF format at &lt;url href="https://stevenclontz.github.io/pretext-getting-started-2023/print/main.pdf" /&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Obtaining these formats from your source is as easy as running clicking a couple buttons in your Codespace.
        PreTeXt supports other types of output as well, including
        Jupyter notebooks, ePub, and tacticle braille code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; You're encouraged to view authoring in
        PreTeXt as an &lt;em&gt;investment&lt;/em&gt;: you may not need the braille output today, but the little
        extra thought and care required to author in PreTeXt will allow you to provide this
        version of your document to a blind student tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

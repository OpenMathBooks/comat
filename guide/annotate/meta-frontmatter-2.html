    &lt;url href="https://pretextbook.org"&gt;PreTeXt&lt;/url&gt; is a document authoring system that allows
    you to convert the source of your document into a variety of output formats, including fully
    accessible webpages, PDF, Epub, Jupyter Notebooks, and braille. This “write once, read
    anywhere” approach has made it a popular choice for authors of Open Educational Resources, but
    PreTeXt can also be used to create other kinds of mathematical documents as well. Recent
    updates make this process much easier; there has never been a better time to get started with
    PreTeXt. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Participants of this workshop will be introduced to the fundamentals of authoring documents
    with PreTeXt and gain the technical skills required to work with it. Specifically,
    participants will learn how to:
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Use GitHub Codespaces to create an editable PreTeXt document in their web browser.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Write and structure content using PreTeXt markup.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Add content to the document, including mathematics, graphics, interactive exercises, and
      more.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Build accessible and interactive webpages as well as a static PDF from the same PreTeXt
      source.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Easily deploy the interactive webpages online (for free).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    We will also share tips for converting existing documents into PreTeXt.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Prior to the workshop, participants should have some familiarity with LaTeX or other markup
    languages.
    No previous experience working with PreTeXt or HTML/XML is assumed.
    Participants should bring a laptop that can connect to JMM's provided wifi: no prior
    installations will be required
    as we will use PreTeXt's new GitHub Codespace-powered online authoring service.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/preface&gt;

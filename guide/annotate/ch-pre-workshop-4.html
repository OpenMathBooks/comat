    &lt;title&gt;Apply for your GitHub Education discount&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Educators and non-profit researchers can get many of GitHub's paid features
        for free.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Apply at
        &lt;url href="https://education.github.com/discount_requests/pack_application"&gt;Education.GitHub.com&lt;/url&gt;
        to unlock these features (in our experience, applications are usually processed quickly for &lt;c&gt;.edu&lt;/c&gt;
        email addresses).
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

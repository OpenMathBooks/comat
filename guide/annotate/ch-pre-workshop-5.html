    &lt;title&gt;And that's it!&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Even just a last year, the process to get started writing PreTeXt
        involved several more steps. (Raise your hand if you don't care what a
        &lt;q&gt;PATH variable&lt;/q&gt; is!)
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        The community is streamlining this experience
        daily, and we look forward to sharing how easy writing in PreTeXt is when we see you at the workshop.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

      Sometimes an activity has multiple parts.  You could give each part as an item on a numbered list, but that would not allow parts to have their own hint/answer/solution.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Instead, you can make each part its own &lt;tag&gt;task&lt;/tag&gt;.  Try writing a multi-part activity, some parts having hints, others having a solution.
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/statement&gt;
&lt;/task&gt;
